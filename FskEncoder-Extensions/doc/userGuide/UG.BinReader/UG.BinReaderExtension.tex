\textbf{Introduction}
\\

The Fsk Encoder application is a usefull tool for SW development in retro computing enviornment.
\\
It's capable of converting binary code or data files into FSK encoded sound samples which can be played on the computers sound card. Together with an appropriate interconnection cable the sound output of the host computer can be connected to the sound input of a retro computer system to upload the data.
\\

This extension (\textit{BinReaderExtension}) enables the FskEncoder application to read binary files.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Description}

Binary files contain programm code or data in plain binary form eighter generated by a programm in the used toolchain or as a result of a memory dump i.e. from a EPROM programmer.
\\

The only metadata that can be obtained from this filetype is the size of it's content. Anything else like i.e. the address where the data should be stored on the target system must be provided by the user.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{GUI}

The BinReaderExtension's specific GUI panel is shown in the \textit{Target specific information
area} of the FskEncoder main GUI and offers a way to enter the start address where the file content should be stored on the target system.
\\

\begin{minipage}{0.50\textwidth}	

	The layout of the panel is shown in the picture beside.

\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}{0.48\textwidth}

	\adjustimage{width=\textwidth, valign=r}{./images/Pnl.TargetExtension-BinReader.png}

\end{minipage}

\vspace{1em}

Because a binary source file can only consist of one single region, the panel contains only one data line labeld \textit{Region 1}. This line contains a textfield '\textit{Start Adr}' in which the start address of the data to be loaded must be entered.
\\

\textbf{Note:} The start address is that address where the data get to be stored in the memory of the target device and depends on the type of the target system as well as on the data itself. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Installation}

The BinReaderExtension comes as \textit{BinReaderExtension-m.s.b.zip} file containing all the necessary folders and files, which must be unpacked in the installation folder of the FskEncoder application.
\\

\textbf{Note:} The .zip file contains a version code consisting of

\begin{enumerate}[align=left, left=2em, labelsep=1.5em]

	\item[m] the main line of the build,
	\item[s] the stream of the build and
	\item[b] the build number.

\end{enumerate}

The main line of the extension \textbf{must} match the one of the application to function propperly.
\\

The extension .zip file provides confiruration snippets which must be merged into the FskEncoder configuration to make the extension accessible (see next section). 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Configuration}

After unpacking the .zip file, three new files apear in the installation directories:

\begin{enumerate}[align=left, left=2em]

	\item \texttt{./bin/BinReaderExtension.bat} containing the Java \verb|CLASS_PATH| extension and must be merged into the \texttt{./bin/FskEncoder.bat} file,
	
	\item \texttt{./cfg/BinReaderExtension.properties} containing a template for the configuration of the \texttt{./cfg/Plugin.properties} file.
	
	\item And at least the extension file \textit{BinReaderExtension.jar} in the \texttt{./extension} directory.

\end{enumerate}

Both, the .bat and .properties files contain instructions on how to merge the extensions into the FskEncoder configuration.
