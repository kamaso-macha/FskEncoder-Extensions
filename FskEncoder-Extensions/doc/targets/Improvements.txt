Z80 Trainer:
  define physically availabel USER RAM in the properties and check in the protocoll
  against that values.
  
  No data should be loaded into SYSTEM or unavailable memory!

Z80 Trainer:
  Allow split block upload:
    A IHX8 file can contain different memory blocks defined by several 'org' statements in the source file.
    E.g. 
      1000 - 17FF,
      2000 - 27FF,
      ...
    
    These memory blocks should be loaded up as different upload actions but triggered
    by only ONE user interaction.
