The FskEncoder follows the linear MVC model where only two interaction paths are possible:

\begin{enumerate}

	\item between View and Control and vice versa,
	
	\item between Control and Model and vice versa.
	
\end{enumerate}

	The top-one, with the caption \textit{Region}\, is the extension GUI of the input reader extension while the lower one (with the field \textit{File Name}\,) is from target system extension.
	\\
	
	These GUI parts are specific to each extension and are part of the extension packages.

Figure \ref{fig:architecture-overview}\, \textit{\nameref{fig:architecture-overview}}\, depicts the global structure of the application together with the extensions:

\begin{itemize}

	\item \textbf{View} This is the main window with all GUI elements exept that of the GUI extensions.

	\item \textbf{Control} This is the control for the main window dealing with every thing exept the extension GUIs.

	\item \textbf{Workflow engine} Encapsulates the \textit{business logic}\, of the FskEncoder application and the extensions.

	\item \textbf{Model} The data model of the application. It holds some run-time data and the paroerties of the two configuration files \textit{FskEncoder.properties}\, and \textit{Plugin.properties}\,.

	\item \textbf{Soundplayer} Plays the sound samples on the selected output device with the desired volume.

	\item \textbf{InputReader Extension view} This is the GUI part of the selected input reader extension and \must provide all informations needed to deal with the input format.
	\\
	The example in the figure above shows the GUI of the Ihx8InputReaderExtension which can handle more than one memory section in a single file.

	\item \textbf{InputReader Extension control} Extension specific control which must handle all controls of the extension gui.

	\item \textbf{TargetSystem Extension view} This is the GUI part of the selected target system extension and \must provide all informations needed to deal with the specific protocol format.

	\item \textbf{TargetSystem Extension control} Extension specific control which must handle all controls of the extension gui.

	\item \textbf{TargetSystem Extension protocol} The protocol used to encode the binary data and to convert them into sound samples.

\end{itemize}

Each input reader and target system extension must be fully decoupled from the FskEncoder source (except the interface / base classes needed) and \shall only interact with the application via the provided interfaces.
\\

A deep dive into how to build those extensions is discussed in the section \ref{extension-instantiation}  \textit{\nameref{extension-instantiation}}\, on page \pageref{extension-instantiation}.
\\

By rule, the application itself and each extension lives in it's own .jar file which must contain all the necessary classes but no 3pty libraries (please refer to section \ref{Project-setup}   \textit{\nameref{Project-setup}}\, on page \pageref{Project-setup} for library management).

\subsection{Project structure}

This section gives an explanation of the different packages and their purposes. The classes are only discussed if there is a real need for the understanding of building extensions. Most of this information can be found in the JavaDoc of the project.
\\

For each package is specified if its classes and interfaces should not, can or must be used in extensions.
\\

\subsection{Application part}

The following source folder / packages and their contents currently exist:

\begin{samepage}
	\begin{addmargin}[1cm]{0cm}
