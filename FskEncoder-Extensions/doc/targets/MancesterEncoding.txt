Algorithm
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Encoding is the process of adding the correct transitions to the message signal 
in relation to the data that is to be sent over the communication system. 

The first step is to establish the data rate that is going to be used. 
Once this is fixed, then the mid-bit time can be determined as Â½ of the data 
rate period. 

In our example we are going to use a data rate of 4kHz. This provides a 
bit period of 1/f = 1/4000 = 0.00025s or 250Âµs.  Dividing by two gives us the 
mid-bit time (which we will label â€œTâ€�) of 125Âµs. 

Now let's look at how we use this to encode a data byte of 0xC5 (11000101b). 

The easiest method to do this is to use a timer set to expire or interrupt at 
the T interval.  We also need to set up a method to track which Â½ bit period we 
are currently sending.  Once we do this, we can easily encode the data and 
output the message signal.


Implementation of Manchester Encoding
  1. Begin with the output signal high.
  2. Check if all bits have been sent, If yes, then go to step 7
  3. Check the next logical bit to be coded
  4. If the bit equals â€œ1â€�, then call ManchesterOne(T)
  5. Else call ManchesterZero(T)
  6. Return to step 2
  7. Set output signal high and return


Implementation of ManchesterOne(T)
  1. Set the output signal low
  2. Wait for mid-bit time (T)
  3. Set the output signal high
  4. Wait for mid-bit time (T)
  5. Return


Implementation of ManchesterZero(T)
  1. Set the output signal high
  2. Wait for mid-bit time (T)
  3. Set the output signal low
  4. Wait for mid-bit time (T)
  5. Return
